# Repository_Scraper
This Scraper uses BeautifulSoup, requests and pandas in Python to scrape top 30 repositories (according to stars) for each topic on Github.

All the topics are saved in the topics.csv file inside "Repository-Scraper" directory. For each topic inside topics.csv, there is a separate csv file inside "Repository-Scraper/topics" directory.
